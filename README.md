# SmartAttendance-Python
This software will be produced by the name of Smart Attendance. This software is designed to help teachers keep an
eye on the attendance of the students and prevent any proxy in attendance. It will be able to do that by marking the
attendance using facial recognition of the students. More, specifically the system is designed to allow the teachers
to manage and update the attendance of the students.

In the academic institutions teachers are the leaders and the symbol of idealism and it is very
important that their time should be managed and effectively utilized. So, to deal with this
“SMART ATTENDANCE” is very effective approach to minimize the issues and problem
regarding attendance. Sometime students play with the academic discipline of the institution in
their own ways and this software will play a crucial role to deal with this kind of stuff truly and
fairly. The software is automated and effectively fast to complete the attendance process with
some special features to focus on the student activities during the whole lecture hour which
results in better coordination and transparency in the system and academic performance of the
student.
